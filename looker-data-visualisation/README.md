# Looker: Data visualisation

We create a Looker Report called ["Dashboard: The Big Five Leagues"](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/69909390-89ee-4183-9fb4-fc5b2e79d860), where we have three tiles:

1. Tile #1: Players Statistics: goal contributions (goals/assists), disciplinary records (yellow/red cards)
2. Tile #2: League Statistics: goal contributions (goals/assists), disciplinary records (yellow/red cards)
3. Tile #3: Relative Performance between the leagues: visualised as a donut chart across different KPIs

We also add a filter on the date range.
